# LTML

LTML, or **Larks' Text Markup Language**, is a declarative markup language for structured terminal documents.\
Think of it as HTML, but natively made for our lovely terminal.

And, who is Larks? All I know is that he knows King Crimson, and you should too.

An ambitious (or it seems so) hobby project for the sake of love of the TUIs.
